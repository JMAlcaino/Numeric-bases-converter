NUMERIC BASE CONVERTER CONTEXT

This small software was designed for educational purposes, to better understand
the representation of numbers in different base systems used in computing.

Why numeric bases?

In computing, data is handled in various numbering systems:
- The decimal system (base 10), used by humans
- The binary system (base 2), used by machines (0 and 1)
- The octal system (base 8), formerly used in some UNIX systems
- The hexadecimal system (base 16), compact, readable, used for memory, colors, encoding

This program allows you to:
- Quickly convert a number from one base to another
- View its equivalent in binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal
- Choose a suitable display format (blocks of 2, 4, 8) to better read binary or hexadecimal data

Link with cryptography

Cryptography and modern encryption systems (SHA-256, AES, RSA, historical Enigma, etc.)
all rely on a deep understanding of numerical representations, particularly binary and hexadecimal.

This converter is a first step towards understanding:
- binary encodings
- hash functions
- encryption keys
- bitwise manipulations

Educational objective

This tool is intended for:
- computer science or electronics students
- teachers wishing to illustrate coding lessons
- cryptography enthusiasts
- curious individuals wanting to understand what machines see

Designed and developed with passion, this program is evolving
and may include other calculation or encoding modules in the future.
