# Navigation and Productivity in VS Code (Python)

This memo gathers the essential VS Code navigation shortcuts and tools to help you work efficiently in your *Numeric Bases Converter* project — especially to explore, understand, and reorganize your code.

---

#  1. Code Navigation

##  Go to Definition
**F12**

Jump directly to the place where a variable, function, or class is defined.

Very useful for:
- finding the origin of a `StringVar()`
- tracking function flow
- inspecting Tkinter menus or callbacks

---

##  Find All References
**Shift + F12**

One of the most powerful tools for understanding a program:

- lists *all* lines where a symbol appears  
- shows the function / section where it is used  
- clean, clickable display  
- perfect for cleanup and refactoring

---

##  Go to Symbol
**Ctrl + Shift + O**

Displays a list of:
- all functions  
- all classes  
- global variables  
- code sections  

You can type to filter.

---

##  Quick Open File
**Ctrl + P**

Opens any file in the project quickly.

Very useful when your project has multiple folders (e.g., `/Documentation`, `/Langues`, `/src`).

---

##  Find in File
**Ctrl + F**

Simple search.

---

##  Find in Entire Project
**Ctrl + Shift + F**

Displays all matches across all project files.

Essential when you modify:
- a text label  
- a variable  
- a function name  
- a JSON translation key  

---

#  2. Navigation “Like a Web Browser”

##  Go Back
**Alt + ←**

Returns where you were before (just like a browser).

##  Go Forward
**Alt + →**

Replays the navigation path.

Very handy when exploring multiple functions.

---

#  3. Visual Tracking Tools

With your improved configuration:

- the **active line** is highlighted  
- the **active line number** is colored  
- **variable occurrences** stand out clearly  
- the theme refreshes instantly  

This makes it much easier to:
- follow a variable  
- analyze complex sections  
- prepare your transition to classes  

---

#  4. Useful Editing Tricks

###  Select a whole line
Click in the left margin, or use:
```
Ctrl + L
```

###  Move a line or block
```
Alt + ↑
Alt + ↓
```

###  Duplicate a line
```
Shift + Alt + ↓
```

###  Format the document
```
Shift + Alt + F
```

---

#  5. Preparing the Move to Classes

These navigation tools help you:

- identify which functions belong together  
- isolate global variables to transform into class attributes  
- understand dependencies between code parts  
- restructure your converter step by step  

VS Code becomes a **real code analysis tool**.

---

#  Conclusion

With these shortcuts and tools:

- you debug faster  
- you understand code structure better  
- you avoid mistakes during reorganizing  
- you prepare a clean shift toward object‑oriented architecture  

This memo is designed to support the long-term evolution of your project.
